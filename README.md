`jsFractalZoom` is an fractal generator/zoomer written in javascript.
 
It was inspired by [XaoS](http://xaos.sourceforge.net/black/index.php).

The code was originally created in May 2011 and is currently being resurrected.
The engine creates GIF images using an ultra fast GIF encoder which has been made available separately [jsGifEncoder](https://github.com/xyzzy/jsGifEncoder). 
 
`jsFractalZoom` is hosted on https://www.rockingship.org/jsFractalZoom
