# Welcome to the wonderful world of (fractal) zooming.

When insufficient resources force you to prioritize which pixels to render first...

This project has 3 Components:

- XaoS inspired fractals as sample content.
- The `zoomer` engine.
- The `splash` video codec.

The only requirement is the implementation of:

```
    /**
     * This is done for every pixel. optimize well!
     * Easy extendable for 3D.
     * Return the pixel value for the given floating point coordinate.
     * Zoomer will use it to fill integer pixel positions. 
     * The positions are ordered in decreasing significance.
     *
     * @param {Zoomer}      zoomer  - ðŸ˜Š
     * @param {ZoomerFrame} frame   - Pixels/Palette/Rotate
     * @param {float}       x       - X coordinate
     * @param {float}       y       - Y coordinate
     * @return {int} - Pixel value           
     */
    onUpdatePixel: (zoomer, frame, x, y) => {
        return <YourCodeHere>;
    },
```

## Experience the fractal zoomer

Click on the image above to start the zoomer at the presented location.  
Or, start vanilla [https://rockingship.github.io/jsFractalZoom/jsFractalZoom.html](https://rockingship.github.io/jsFractalZoom/jsFractalZoom.html)

Suggestions for the best experience:
- Enable full-screen. If the browser gives too much of a hassle, there is a button in the top right corner.
- Fly around in high speed to nice places.
- Too much noise, with the wheel you can adjust focus like a microscope.
- Drag to position photogenic.
- Staying put enables turbo mode for maximum calculations.
- Rendering is complete when "quality" (top status line in menu) reaches "1".
- Menu has many goodies. The control panel can be resized.
- Panel buttons "save" to save PNG or "url" to copy weblink to clipboard.

Saving:
- Files are PNG.
- Panels and text are removed.
- PNG contains navigation and setting information.
- Drop PNG on zoomer page to load settings.

Tips for 4K:
- Switch to HD resolution for fast navigation
- For scenic locations switch to 4K for maximum quality

For desktop (primary design target):
- Use `ctrl+` / `ctrl-` to change display resolution. For highest quality match this to your screen.
- Mouse left: zoom in
- Mouse right: zoom out
- Wheel pressed: drag
- Wheel turn: focus

Touch screen:
- Hold horizontal if buttons are too small.
- Disable rotation for a performance boost.
- 1-finger: drag
- 2-fingers: navigation. You can release one finger afterwards.
- 3-fingers: focus. You can release two fingers. Then with your second finger use the screen like it being a wheel.

Multi-monitor wallpapers:
- Find location to your liking.
- Press "URL" to copy settings to clipboard
- Paste clipboard in URL bar and append `&w=<width>&h=<height>` reflecting your total multi-monitor size.
- Resize window to minimize margins.
- Reload adapted URL to adjust internals accordingly.
- Wait for quality to reach "1".
- "SAVE".

### A Pixel is not a Pixel

The CSS standard has sadly botched the meaning of DPI by fixating it to being 96.  
To make matters worse, browser builders botched it further (especially on mobile) by differentiating between CSS and Physical pixels.  
Even the latter is not always what it seems.

The fractal zoomer displays a popup when it detects screen resolution changes.  
For maximum quality the resolution should match that of your display.

On desktop, you can change the resolution with `ctrl+` and `ctrl-`.  
Mobile sets CSS pixels which could be as low as 560x360, this to save battery.  
To switch to physical pixels, toggle the `HiRes` button on the control panel.

# The `zoomer` architecture

# The `zoomer` API

Zoomer is full-screen canvas orientated.  
All interaction with the physical environment (DOM) is done through callbacks.  
Coordinates are floating point, pixel locations are integer.
Scaling those two is a design fundamental.
Rotation is also fully integrated with a minimal performance penalty.
`devicePixelDensity` is a natural environment and integrates seamlessly.

Being full-screen oriented, HTML positioning is absolute.
CSS for centering and padding the canvas.
Javascript to glue resources.

The following template is a bare minimum:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Example</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <style>
        body {
            position: absolute;
            border: none;
            margin: auto;
            padding: 0;
            height: 100%;
            width: 100%;
            top: 0;
            right: 0;
            bottom: 0;
            left: 0;
        }
        #idZoomer {
            position: absolute;
            border: none;
            margin: auto;
            padding: 0;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
            top: 0;
            right: 0;
            bottom: 0;
            left: 0;
        }
    </style>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="zoomer.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<canvas id="idZoomer"> </canvas>
<script type="text/javascript">
    "use strict";

    window.addEventListener("load", function () {

        /**
         * Get canvas to draw on (mandatory)
         * @type {HTMLElement}
         */
        const domZoomer = document.getElementById("idZoomer");

        /**
         * Get context 2D (mandatory), "desynchronized" is faster but may glitch hovering mouse (optional)
         * @type {CanvasRenderingContext2D}
         */
        const ctx = domZoomer.getContext("2d", {desynchronized: true});

        // get available client area
        const realWidth = Math.round(document.body.clientWidth * window.pixelDensityRatio);
        const realHeight = Math.round(document.body.clientHeight * window.pixelDensityRatio);

        // set canvas size (mandatory)		
        domZoomer.width = realWidth;
        domZoomer.height = realHeight;

        /**
         * Create zoomer (mandatory)
         * @type {Zoomer}
         */
        const zoomer = new Zoomer(realWidth, realHeight, false, OPTIONS);

        /**
         * Create a small key frame (mandatory)
         * @type {ZoomerView}
         */
        const keyView = new ZoomerView(64, 64, 64, 64);

        // Calculate all the pixels (optional), or choose any other content 
        keyView.fill(initialX, initialY, initialRadius, initialAngle, zoomer, zoomer.onUpdatePixel);

        // set initial position and inject key frame (mandatory)
        zoomer.setPosition(initialX, initialY, initialRadius, initialAngle, keyView);

        // start engine (mandatory)
        zoomer.start();
    });
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

The only mandatory addition is the contents of `OPTIONS` which are initial values for any or all `zoomer` properties.

All callbacks have the zoomer instance as first argument for easy engine access.
In combination with arrow functions, `this` is caller/DOM namespace and `zoomer` is engine/webworker namespace.

Most important properties are:

```
const OPTIONS = {
    /**
     * Frames per second.
     * Rendering frames is expensive, too high setting might render more than calculate.
     * If a too high setting causes a frame to drop, `zoomer` will lower this setting with 10%
     *
     * @member {float} - Frames per second
     */
    frameRate: 20,

    /**
     * Disable web-workers.
     * Offload frame rendering to web-workers.
     * When ever the default changes, you will appreciate it explicitly being noted.
     * You cannot use webworkers if you add protected recources to frames.
     *
     * @member {boolean} - disable/Enable web workers.
     */

        // draw frame onto canvas. `ctx` is namespace of caller.
        ctx.putImageData(imagedata, 0, 0);
    },

}
```

## Function declaration

There are two styles of function declaration, traditional and arrow notation.
Both are identical in functionality and performance.
Difference is the binding of `this`.
With `function()` the bind is the web-worker event queue, with `() => { }` the bind is the DOM event queue.

```
  (a,b,c) => { }       - Strongly advised
  function(a,b,c) { }  - Expert mode
```

# Background

`jsFractalZoom` is an fractal generator/zoomer written in javascript. It was inspired by XaoS, [https://xaos.sourceforge.net/black/index.php](https://xaos.sourceforge.net/black/index.php).

The project was originally created in May 2011, resurrected in 2018 and extended in 2020.

The 2020 version is canvas based. The 2018 engine created GIF images using an ultra fast GIF encoder [https://github.com/xyzzy/jsGifEncoder](https://github.com/xyzzy/jsGifEncoder).
 
## Demos

There are 3 demos. All are work-in-progress and may not work in any/all situations.
